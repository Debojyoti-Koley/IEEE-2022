    <h3 class="student_branch">IEEE SJCE Student branch</h3>

    <p class="wd_p">
        <img src="s1.gif" alt="" class="img1">
        IEEE-SJCE Student Branch which started as an elite group 29 years ago, today has sprawled throughout the campus of SJCE,
        making the students technically more competitive, more professional and capable of enhancing their abilities as an
        engineer. Since then IEEE-SJCE STUDENT BRANCH, a division under Region 10 of IEEE has been known for the immensity with
        which its members were bestowed. The very success story of its students as professionals into their respective fields
        after graduations speaks of its standards.
        <br>
        <br>
        IEEE-SJCE now has about 330+ members from six fields of engineering: Biotechnology, Computer Science, Electronics &
        Communication, Electrical & Electronics, Information Science, and Instrumentation Technology. Apart from these many
        students from various post-graduation departments have also subscribed to be members.
        <br>
        <br>
        IEEE-SJCE conducts two annual technical fests - TUXEDO, a Linux fest during the odd semesters, and CYBERIA, the annual
        technical fest conducted during the even semesters. CYBERIA was instigated 19 years ago and has been organized for 18
        years now. The events in the fest are so organized as to give students from all branches of engineering, irrespective of
        them being members or not, and irrespective of their branches, a chance to showcase their talents and abilities.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="s2.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
        To make students technically competitive, technical tests on C programming microprocessors etc. are conducted.
        Various workshops and crash courses are also organized. An annual leadership workshop adorns the calendar of events
        every year, which helps the students to improve as leaders and inculcates in them the spirits of true leaders. Apart
        from this, a number of talks are organized by people representing industry, academia, and research as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        The standards of IEEE-SJCE were proven the best when it was awarded the Best Student Branch for the year 2003-2004.
        Among the competitors for this tag were the top colleges of VTU, Manipal Institute of Technology, and NITK, Surathkal as
        well.
        <br>
        <br>
        IEEE-SJCE is also proud of nurturing the IEEE-EDS STUDENT CHAPTER. IEEE-SJCE is the only student branch to have gained
        permission to start this chapter throughout India. IEEE-SJCE also has a Women in Engineering Student Chapter.

        <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="s3.gif" alt="" class="img3">
            IEEE-SJCE EDS has been providing students with basic electronics knowledge since its inception. It has helped students get better familiarized with electronic components, the various techniques of circuit making, and the basics of robot building.
        </p>

        <h4>SNAP CIRCUIT</h4>
        <p>
            Snap circuit product is a tool for entering the exciting world of electronics. Electronics play an increasingly important role in our everyday lives, and so it is important to have some basic knowledge of them. In this workshop, the students have a hands-on session of basic electrical and electronics circuits. The workshop is conducted for first and second year students exclusively. The students are allowed to explore different circuits with the help of the manuals which come along with the kits under the supervision of volunteers.
        </p>
        


        <h4>SOLDERING AND ETCHING WORKSHOP</h4>
        <p>
            Soldering is a concept used in every electronic appliance. It is necessary to know the proper soldering techniques. Keeping this in mind, IEEE-SJCE EDS conducts Soldering and Etching workshops in odd semesters, where senior IEEE EDS members teach the 2nd years and 1st years. They make participants etch a simple circuit and solder it.webThe main highlights of the workshop were that the participants got to learn robotics from scratch and then move on to more advanced topics like Bluetooth-controlled robots, voice-controlled robots, DTMF-controlled robots, and even Android app-controlled robots.
        </p>
        

        <h4>VACATION PROJECT MANIA</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="s4.jpg" alt="" class="img4">
            "Whatever we possess becomes of double value when we have the opportunity of sharing it with others", this famous adage of Jean Nicolas embodies the idea of conducting VPM. Vacation Project Mania, an initiative of IEEE-SJCE EDS is conducted during the vacations. VPM is an interactive session in which the seniors and juniors mingle together to share their knowledge, ideas, and most important of all, an experience, but the torch bearers of this successful mania are the seniors without a doubt. VPM gets a huge response from all circuit branches, around 120+ students attend the project sessions every day for 4 hours. VPM plays a prominent role in generating practical impulse in the minds of young budding engineers.
        </p>
        

        <h4>ROBOTICS WORKSHOP</h4>
        <p>
          As they say, our knowledge is volatile until we apply the concept of our knowledge in a real-time situation. Hence "Robotics", one of the biggest events in SJCE, is conducted annually by the IEEE-SJCE EDS Chapter. The workshop starts from building basic robots and ends with the participants being able to build robots that use collision avoidance and are controlled using mobile phones through DTMF.

            <br>
            
            The idea of WIE chapter in IEEE-SJCE student branch was conceived and implemented only a couple of years ago. Since its
            inception, the chapter has been responsible for several activities and initiatives. WIE team has made frequent visits to
            several organizations to reach out to underprivileged children and educate them about their chances in engineering.
            <br>
            <br>

            IEEE-SJCE WIE also organises distinguished lectures by women professionals who help in encouraging young girls to strive hard and motivate them in achieving excellence in academics and profession. Apart from this, the WIE chapter of the student branch is also involved in organising technical competitions and workshops. The team intends to continue these activities along with the implementation of newer ideas.
